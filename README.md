## What this repo is for

This repo hosts sample code referred to and used as part of [tutorials for IBM MQ on IBM Developer](https://developer.ibm.com/components/ibm-mq/).

## Where to find code to copy/paste into your app

We have a wealth of messaging patterns, represented in many languages, including Java, .NET, Python, Node.js and Golang. [They are available at the mq-dev-patterns repo, here!](https://github.com/ibm-messaging/mq-dev-patterns)
